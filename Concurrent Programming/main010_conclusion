# When to use Python threading

There’re two main tasks:

1. I/O-bound tasks – the time spending on I/O significantly more than the time spending on computation
2. CPU-bound tasks – the time spending on computation is significantly higher than the time waiting for I/O.

Python threading is optimized for I/O bound tasks.
For example, requesting remote resources, connecting a database server, or reading and writing files.
